# Human Tracking Robotic Walking Table (Ongoing Project...)

## Project Acknowledgements: A Table with a Mind of Its Own ü§ñ
What if furniture could do more than just sit there? For people with disabilities or mobility challenges, a table that follows you could make daily life easier‚Äîdelivering essentials, reducing the need to reach or move heavy objects, and adding independence at home. That‚Äôs the big idea behind this project: a human-tracking robotic walking table!

Inspiration comes from the incredible work of Theo Jansen, a Dutch artist and engineer who creates massive, wind-powered walking sculptures called Strandbeests (Dutch for "beach animals"). Jansen's creations are more than just art; they're intricate mechanical systems that move with an almost life like grace. He designed a special linkage a system of rods and pivots that converts the simple spinning motion of a windmill into a smooth, elegant walking stride. ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÄ

Jansen's genius lies in his ability to make complex mechanics look effortless and organic. He even considers his Strandbeests to be "new forms of life" and envisions a future where they can survive and evolve independently on beaches. We've taken a page from his playful, inventive approach to engineering. Instead of using a linkage to make a sculpture walk, we're using it to give a table legs. We're infusing the project with that same sense of curiosity and wonder, turning a static piece of furniture into a dynamic, interactive companion.

This project is a blend of art and engineering, combining the beautiful mechanics of the Strandbeests with modern robotics. We're using sensors to detect your location and a motor to power the walking mechanism, so the table can follow you around and always be at your service. It's a fun, quirky, and challenging build that will hopefully inspire you to see the world‚Äîand your furniture‚Äîin a whole new way. Let's get building! üõ†Ô∏è
